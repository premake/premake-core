Description: Build Script Generator
 Premake allows you to manage your project configuration in one
 place and still support those pesky IDE-addicted Windows coders
 and/or cranky Linux command-line junkies. It allows you to generate
 project files for tools that you do not own. It saves the time that
 would otherwise be spent manually keeping several different toolsets
 in sync. And it provides an easy upgrade path as new versions of your
 favorite tools are released.
