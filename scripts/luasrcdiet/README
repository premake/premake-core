========================================================================

WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 0.12.1
----------------------------

* Fixed a long comment glitch when using the --keep option. (Two
  extra characters were duplicated before the ending brackets.)

* Faster function call syntax sugar optimization using a one-pass
  token deletion loop.

WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 0.12.0
----------------------------

* Added single-file versions of LuaSrcDiet in various sizes. First
  done by some other projects that packaged LuaSrcDiet, e.g. eLua.

* BUG FIX: String optimization of "\ddd" type escape mechanism,
  "\00101" was incorrectly optimized to "\101".

* --opt-srcequiv: Source equivalence checking. Tries hard to compare
  'before' and 'after' lexer token streams for equivalence.

* --opt-binequiv: Binary chunk equivalence checking. Tries hard to
  compare 'before' and 'after' binary chunks for equivalence.

* When using --opt-eols, the last EOL character is now removed.

* --opt-experimental: Turns on a few experimental optimizations:
  (a) ';' operator removal (deleted or turned into whitespace).
  (b) f("string") f('string') f([[string]]) calls are turned
      into their syntactic sugar equivalents, e.g. f"string"

* Plugins are now embedded into single-file versions.

* First release of completed documentation files.

* New Makefile and numerous minor updates.

* Old code for Lua 5.0 removed.

BUGS
----

* Nothing in my list. See below for limitations...

INCOMPLETE SUPPORT
------------------

* Locals optimization does NOT understand implicit 'arg' locals in
  vararg functions (see option LUA_COMPAT_VARARG in the Lua sources).

* NO support in lexer for decimal points other than '.'.

* NO support in lexer for Lua 5.0.x nested long strings.

EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE
---------------------

LuaSrcDiet is "experimental software". For LuaSrcDiet, this means that
it was coded for one user -- the coder. Although I may be able to help
LuaSrcDiet users, there should not be any expectation of 'support'.

Don't hook this thing up to nuclear missiles.

I don't have the time for steady maintenance or for building up and
cultivating a user base, so developers are welcome to fork LuaSrcDiet or
incorporate it into their own software, as long as authorship
attribution for LuaSrcDiet source code is maintained. Say if LuaSrcDiet
is called as a separate program, then it is simply an aggregation of
separate software and each program should stick to its own license.

Programs you process using LuaSrcDiet are of course not affected at all
by LuaSrcDiet's license; it's just a text filter. See COPYRIGHT. If you
insist on extreme COPYRIGHT views, then better delete this whole thing
right away, then gouge your eyes out. :-p

OLDER STUFF
-----------

There has been some slash-and-burn going on. I'm inclined to move
forward, and not spend time maintaining older stuff forever. If you
still need the older stuff, they can be found in:

* Lua 5.0.x old versions: last seen in version 0.11.2.

* Lua 5.1.x old codebase: last seen in version 0.11.2.

FUTURE PLANS
------------

Lua 5.1.x releases for LuaSrcDiet will pretty much stagnate at 0.12.1
after implementation of a couple more experimental optimizations, and
effort will be shifted towards something for Lua 5.2.x. The timeline for
this is indeterminate.

========================================================================

USING LUASRCDIET

Now is a good time to take a look at the documentation. Start with
LuaSrcDiet.html in the doc directory.

LuaSrcDiet is now packaged as a single-file Lua script for maximum
convenience. Just drop it in and splice something into your Makefile.

New source stream and binary chunk equivalence checking minimizes the
possibility of LuaSrcDiet borking your stuff.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Coded using SciTE. Developed mostly under Cygwin with a generic Lua
5.1.4 binary.
