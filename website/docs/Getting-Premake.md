title: Getting Premake
---

Visit [the Downloads page](http://premake.github.io/download.html) for the latest pre-built binary and source packages. Or, clone the premake-core Git repository right here on GitHub: find the "Clone" option in the sidebar to the right and follow the instructions there, then see [Building Premake](building-premake) to learn how to create binaries for your system.

Premake 5.0 is still in very active development, and we haven't yet reached the point of making official releases yet (though we're getting close). There will absolutely be bugs and [missing functionality](feature-matrix) right now. Please help us by [reporting issues you find](https://github.com/premake/premake-core/issues) so we can get them fixed before the final release.
